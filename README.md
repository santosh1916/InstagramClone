# InstagramClone
The Instagram clone I built utilizes Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB for the backend, with EJS as the view engine. It incorporates user authentication, post creation, image uploads using Multer, post likes, and comments, showcasing a simplified version of Instagram's core functionalities.
